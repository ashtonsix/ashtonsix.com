**Engineering Manager at Researcher (April 2019 to December 2019)**

- Figured out how all the internal software and infrastructure fit together,
  shared the knowledge with everyone, and suggested improvements. Reduced
  monthly infrastructure spend from $10,000-ish to $5,000-ish
- Ad-hoc problem solving, coaching, planning. Like, vetting tech choices and
  helping decide what to build next
- Convinced everyone it was a good idea to migrate from a custom ad solution to
  Google Ad Manager
- Made the web app (only person available with relevant skills, product was
  mobile-first)

**Founder of Salamander (July 2018 to April 2019)**

- Bootstrapped a deep learning platform with just \$10,000, and acquired 2,000
  customers
- Automated provisioning of cheap but hard-to-use “spot servers” to make them be
  like expensive but easy-to-use “on-demand servers”. Many startups tried this,
  but I used clever tricks to do it better: at pricing, availability, and server
  boot-up time. See this third party comparison:

  it shows Salamander was the best-value solution out of 20 competitors by a
  wide margin
- Created a user experience that, according to customers, was “super intuitive”,
  “a god-tier setup”, and “addressed a lot of pain points that other platforms
  couldn't”
- Sold the company to fast.ai
- No longer available, but you can see what it used to look like at
